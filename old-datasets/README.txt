This is the datasets we used. The two files benign-subset.txt and
malicious-subset.txt were used for fine grained optimisation. The remaining
files for coarse grained optimisation. All files are scaled to the interval [-1,
+1] and are ready to use with libsvm. The columns of the files represent the
flow attributes (source port, destination port, ...).
